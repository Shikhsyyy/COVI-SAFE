# COVI-SAFE
An Electronic System Built on the main purpose of making a closed vicinity COVID-Safe.  Technologies Used : Arduino Programming with Real time Sensors integration and Matlab GUI with Voice Alert 

Here are the Features of the Project
1. Bidirectional People Counter: Counts the number of people entering a room and gives an alert when the maximum limit is reached.

2. Mask Detection Using Matlab GUI: Detects whether the person is wearing a mask properly or not or not wearing it at all and gives a voice alert.

3. Contact Less Temperature Sensing:
Checks the temperature of the person entering the room and Opens the door of the room only when the person has a normal body temperature.
